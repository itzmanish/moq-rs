/// policy of what counts as "internal". A relay with no tagger
/// (`RelayConfig.connection_tagger = None`) treats every inbound connection as
/// public. Interface classification is deliberately separate from
/// [`Coordinator::resolve_scope`], which resolves *identity and permissions*;
/// the coordinator cannot know the transport interface a connection arrived on.
///
/// # Where classification happens (important)
///
/// The `public`/`internal` label is **local to the relay that accepts the
/// connection and is never sent over the wire**. Each relay classifies its own
/// inbound connections independently:
///
/// * Connections the relay dials itself (`--announce`, [`RemoteManager`]) are
///   tagged [`SessionInterface::Internal`] at dial time and never reach a
///   tagger.
/// * When relay A dials relay B, the MoQT handshake carries **no** "I am a
///   relay" signal. Relay B must recognize relay A purely from the raw
///   connection attributes in [`ConnectionMeta`]. If relay B has no tagger, it
///   treats relay A as a public client.
///
/// So to make a relay-to-relay link internal on the accepting end, the tagger
/// must identify the dialing relay from what actually crosses the wire:
///
/// * [`ConnectionMeta::remote_addr`] — the dialer's source IP/port (e.g. match
///   an internal subnet or allowlist).
/// * [`ConnectionMeta::local_ip`] — the local IP/interface the connection was
///   accepted on (e.g. match an internal-facing VIP on a multi-homed or
///   anycast host).
/// * [`ConnectionMeta::server_name`] — the TLS SNI the dialer presents, derived
///   from the host of the URL it dialed, so relays that dial an internal
///   hostname can be matched here.
/// * [`ConnectionMeta::path`] — the connection path from the dialed URL.
///
/// For a mesh where both relays should see each other as internal, both relays
/// need a tagger, and each must dial the other on an address/SNI/path the
/// peer's tagger recognizes.
///
/// # Implementing a tagger
///
/// Return [`ConnectionTags`] carrying the [`TAG_INTERFACE`] tag (via
/// [`ConnectionTags::with_interface`]); empty/untagged results resolve to
/// [`SessionInterface::Public`]. Then wire the tagger into the relay through
