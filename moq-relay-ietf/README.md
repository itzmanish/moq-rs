# moq-relay

A server that connects publishing clients to subscribing clients.
SUBSCRIBE requests are deduplicated and cached, so that a single publisher can serve many subscribers.
Standalone FETCH requests always create a fresh upstream request and are never cached or deduplicated.

Remote FETCH is limited to one relay hop and requires both a configured node URL and an inbound connection tagger. Coordinator origin URLs must include the connection path that resolves to the requested scope.

## Usage

The publisher must choose a unique name for their broadcast, sent as the WebTransport path when connecting to the server.
Connection paths are normalized and validated: trailing slashes are trimmed, dot segments and percent-encoded characters are rejected, and empty segments are not allowed. Capitalization matters.

For example: `CONNECT https://relay.quic.video/BigBuckBunny`

The MoqTransport handshake includes a `role` parameter, which must be `publisher` or `subscriber`.
The specification allows a `both` role but you'll get an error.

You can have one publisher and any number of subscribers connected to the same path.
If the publisher disconnects, then all subscribers receive an error and will not get updates, even if a new publisher reuses the path.
